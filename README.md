### Hi Folks! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/send0moka/send0moka/main/wave.gif" width="22"> I'm Jehian.

Undergraduate Informatics Student at Jenderal Soedirman University. I'm passionate about creating things whether websites, applications or side projects. I enjoy tinkering with backend development and am currently focused on grinding my JavaScript/TypeScript skills. In the future, I aim to learn Zig or Go. I consider myself a lifelong learner - constantly keeping up with new technologies and looking for opportunities to continue growing.
